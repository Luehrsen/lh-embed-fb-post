Wordpress Plugin to embed facebook posts inside wordpress, just from posting the url in the content.

== Description ==
What this plugin essentially does, it looks for facebook post urls in your content and replaces the urls with the code needed to display embedded posts.

Facebook JS SDK
Please keep in mind, that you will need an facebook JS SDK on the page in order for the plugin (or the facebook tags) to work. But as a little gift we implemented an JS SDK for you, you just have to activate it in the "General" tab in your facebook settings.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder from the zip to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on your server.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Place an facebook post URL in your Wordpress posts.
