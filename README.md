allfacebook.de Embed FB
===========

Version 1.0

Wordpress Plugin to embed facebook posts inside wordpress, just from posting the url in the content. 

by [Hendrik Luehrsen](http://www.luehrsen-heinrich.de) & [allfacebook.de](http://www.allfacebook.de)


### Usage
Get the permanent link to your facebook post (by clicking on the date on facebook) and post that into your wordpress editor. Done. No, really!
(The URLs should look like this https://www.facebook.com/marketingde/posts/10151629856623751, or this https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=550281288366776&set=a.126858794042363.19387.125019407559635&type=1 )

### Facebook JS SDK
Please keep in mind, that you will need an facebook JS SDK on the page in order for the plugin (or the facebook tags) to work.
But as a little gift we implemented an JS SDK for you, you just have to activate it in the "General" tab in your facebook settings.


### Installing
You install this plugin like every other (non Wordpress hosted) plugin. Download [the zip](https://github.com/Luehrsen/lh-embed-fb-post/archive/master.zip), unzip the archive and put the folder "lh-embed-fb-post" in to the "wp-content/plugins" folder of your wordpress installation. That's how easy it is!
