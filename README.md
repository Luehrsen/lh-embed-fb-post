===========

Version 1.0

Wordpress Plugin to embed facebook posts inside wordpress, just from posting the url in the content.

### Facebook JS SKD
Please keep in mind, that you will need an facebook JS SDK on the page in order for the plugin (or the facebook tags) to work.
But as a little gift we implemented an JS SDK for you, you just have to activate it in the "General" tab in your facebook settings.


### Installing
You install this plugin like every other (non Wordpress hosted) plugin. Download [the zip](https://github.com/Luehrsen/lh-embed-fb-post/archive/master.zip), unzip the archive and put the folder "lh-embed-fb-post" in to the "wp-content/plugins" folder of your wordpress installation. That's how easy it is!

### Licence
This little piece of software is licensed under GPLv2. So sharing is caring! Implement codes and bits into your own plugins and themes and build awesome stuff! Just give us a little bit of credit! :)
